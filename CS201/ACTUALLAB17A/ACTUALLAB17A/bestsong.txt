Hey little boy, whatcha got there?
kind sir it's a mollusk i've found
did you find it in the sandy ground?
does it emulate the ocean's sound?
yes I found it on the ground
emulating the ocean's sound
bring forth the mollusk cast unto me
let's be forever let forever be free

Hey little boy come walk with me
and bring your new found mollusk along
does it speaketh of the trinity
can it gaze at the sun with its wandering eye
yes it speaks of the trinity
casting light at the sun with its wandering eye
bring forth the mollusk, cast unto me
let's be forever let forever be free

You see there are three things that spur the mollusk from the sand
the waking of all creatures that live on the land
and with just one faint glance, back into the sea
the mollusk lingers, with it's wandering eye...
